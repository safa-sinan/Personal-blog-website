                <p><q>This vanilla cake recipe is so easy to make, feel free to go big on the decoration. A simple dusting
                    of icing sugar or edible flowers are our go-to options</q></p>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <l>
                    <li>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. </li>
                    <li>Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light
                        and fluffy, about 3
                        minutes. </li>
                    <li> Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the
                        bowl as needed.</li>
                    <li> Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the
                        flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until
                        just smooth.</li>
                    <li>Using margarine rather than butter works really well for this cake and saves you the bother and
                        time of having to soften the butter before you start. Don't be tempted to open the oven before
                        40 minutes - you'll regret it. </li>
                    <li>Put the cake in an airtight container and it can be stored for up
                        to 2 days.
